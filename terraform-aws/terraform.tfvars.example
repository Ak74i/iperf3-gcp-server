# Server Configuration

# existing_subnet_id = "subnet-xxxxxxxxx"

# Security
ssh_cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]  # WARNING: This allows SSH from anywhere!
# For better security, use your specific IP:

# Optional Features

# ===============================================
# COMMON DEPLOYMENT SCENARIOS
# ===============================================

# 1. BASIC TESTING (Lowest Cost)
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# instance_type = "c5n.large"
# use_spot_instance = true
# spot_max_price = "0.035"

# 2. HIGH PERFORMANCE TESTING
# instance_type = "c5n.2xlarge"
# use_elastic_ip = true
# enable_enhanced_networking = true

# 3. PRODUCTION/LONG-TERM DEPLOYMENT
# use_elastic_ip = true
# enable_monitoring = true
# enable_auto_stop = true
# log_retention_days = 30

# 4. SECURITY-FOCUSED DEPLOYMENT
# ssh_cidr_blocks = ["YOUR_OFFICE_IP/32"]
# enable_instance_metadata_v2 = true

# ===============================================
# REGIONAL CONFIGURATIONS
# ===============================================

# London (EU-West-2) - Good for Europe
# aws_region = "eu-west-2"
# instance_type = "c5n.xlarge"

# N. Virginia (US-East-1) - Lowest costs
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# instance_type = "c5n.xlarge"

# Frankfurt (EU-Central-1) - Good for Central Europe
# aws_region = "eu-central-1"
# instance_type = "c5n.xlarge"

# Tokyo (AP-Northeast-1) - Good for Asia
# aws_region = "ap-northeast-1"
# instance_type = "c5n.xlarge"

# ===============================================
# INSTANCE TYPE RECOMMENDATIONS
# ===============================================

# For 3+ Gbps Testing:
# c5n.large    - Up to 10 Gbps  (~$0.11/hr) - Budget option
# c5n.xlarge   - Up to 25 Gbps  (~$0.22/hr) - ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED
# c5n.2xlarge  - Up to 25 Gbps  (~$0.43/hr) - High performance
# m5n.xlarge   - Up to 25 Gbps  (~$0.24/hr) - More balanced

# ===============================================
# COST ESTIMATES (US-East-1, On-Demand)
# ===============================================

# c5n.large:   ~$78/month  (24/7), ~$2.60/day (8 hours)
# c5n.xlarge:  ~$156/month (24/7), ~$5.20/day (8 hours)
# c5n.2xlarge: ~$312/month (24/7), ~$10.40/day (8 hours)

# Spot instances can reduce costs by 60-70%

# ===============================================
# QUICK START EXAMPLES
# ===============================================

# Minimal configuration (just change these):
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# key_name   = "your-key-name"

# Cost-optimized configuration:
# aws_region = "us-east-1"
# key_name   = "your-key-name"
# instance_type = "c5n.large"
# use_spot_instance = true
# spot_max_price = "0.035"

# High-performance configuration:
# aws_region = "eu-west-2"
# key_name   = "your-key-name"
# instance_type = "c5n.2xlarge"
# use_elastic_ip = true
# enable_monitoring = true
